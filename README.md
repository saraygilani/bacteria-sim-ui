## Objective:
To simulate engineered bacteria navigating towards a tumor site. This simulation explores basic concepts of bacteria movement and chemotaxis (movement toward chemical gradients), a phenomenon that has potential applications in targeted cancer treatment.

## Motivation:
- This simulation demonstrates a core principle for any such system: autonomous movement toward a target (tumor).
- The long-term vision is to develop this simple simulation into a full-fledged tool for studying bacterial navigation in medical applications.

## Simulated Features:
- A simple, visually-guided 20x20 grid.
- Red dot represents a tumor.
- Green dots represent bacteria, which move toward the tumor.
- Bacteria randomly wander or directly head toward the tumor, mimicking chemotaxis behavior.

## Future Vision:
This is a proof of concept. Here are the envisioned expansions:
- Chemotaxis-based Movement: Simulate gradient sensing for more realistic behavior.
- Bacteria Growth/Death: Implement mechanisms for bacteria to “die” if they stray too far from the target or after a set time.
- Collision Avoidance: Add features where bacteria avoid colliding with each other while navigating.
- Real-World Simulation: Eventually integrate real-world variables, such as pH, temperature, and bacterial response to these conditions.

## Tools and Technology Used:
- Frontend: React for UI rendering and state management.
- Styling: HTML, CSS for fast, responsive design.
- Logic: Simple JavaScript algorithms to model bacteria movement.
